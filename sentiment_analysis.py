###### Data Quality Checks ######

# Checking column names
print(f"This is a list of column names: {list(df.columns)}")

# Checking the brands listed in the data file (checking all files are labelled Amazon)
print(f"\n\nThe list of brands in this file is: {df['brand'].unique()}")

# Data Quality check: visual check to make sure product names are aligned with the categories (data entry issue)

###### Data Preprocessing ######

#Selecting the reviews and the titles of the products

###### Processing the data with NLP ######


# This function convert the letters to lowercase and stripping leading or trailing white spaces.
# This text gets passed through spaCy's NLP pipeline for processing.
# lemmatizing the tokens, and removing stop words and punctuation from the reviews

###### Semantic Similarity between a selection of Reviews ######
